The basic data unit in the sits package is the SITS tibble, which is 

```{r}
# Get a data set containing samples for two classes ("Cerrado" and "Pasture")
cerrado.tb <- sits_getdata(file = system.file("extdata/samples/cerrado.json.gz", package="sits"))
cerrado.tb
```

this needs to be explained further....
