abstract: Using time series derived from big Earth Observation data sets is one of the leading research trends in Land Use Science and Remote Sensing. One of the more promising uses of satellite time series is its application for classification of land use and land cover, since our growing demand for natural resources has caused major environmental impacts. Given this motivation, this package provides a set of tools for data access, filtering, clustering and classification of satellite image time series.
