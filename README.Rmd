## Overview

`sits` is an open source R package for satellite image time series analysis. It enables users to apply machine learning techniques for classifying image time series obtained from earth observation data cubes. The basic workflow in  `sits` is:

1. Select an image collection available on cloud providers AWS, Brazil Data Cube, Digital Earth Africa, Copernicus Data Space, Digital Earth Australia, Microsoft Planetary Computer, NASA Harmonized Landsat/Sentinel, and Swiss Data Cube. 
2. Build a regular data cube from analysis-ready image collections.
3. Extract labelled time series from data cubes to be used as training samples.
4. Perform samples quality control using self-organised maps.
5. Train machine learning and deep learning models.
6. Tune deep learning models for improved accuracy.
7. Classify data cubes using machine learning and deep learning models.
8. Run spatial-temporal segmentation methods for object-based time series classification.
9. Post-process classified images with Bayesian smoothing to remove outliers. 
10. Estimate uncertainty values of classified images.
11. Evaluate classification accuracy using best practices.
12. Improve results with active learning and self-supervised learning methods.

## Installation

### Pre-Requisites

The `sits` package relies on the geospatial packages `sf`, `stars`, `gdalcubes` and `terra`, which depend on the external libraries GDAL and PROJ. Please follow the instructions for installing `sits` from the [Setup chapter of the on-line sits book](https://e-sensing.github.io/sitsbook/setup.html).

### Obtaining `sits`

`sits` can be installed from CRAN: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("sits")
```

The latest supported version is available on github. It may have additional fixes from the version available from CRAN. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("e-sensing/sits", dependencies = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# load the sits library
library(sits)
```

### Support for GPU 

Classification using torch-based deep learning models in `sits` uses CUDA compatible NVIDIA GPUs if available, which provides up 10-fold speed-up compared to using CPUs only. Please see the [installation instructions](https://torch.mlverse.org/docs/articles/installation) for more information on how to install the required drivers. 


## Building Earth Observation Data Cubes

### Image Collections Accessible by `sits`

Users create data cubes from analysis-ready data (ARD) image collections available in cloud services. The collections accessible in `sits` `r packageVersion("sits")` are:

- Brazil Data Cube - [BDC](https://data.inpe.br/bdc/web/en/home-page-2/): Open data collections of Sentinel-2, Landsat-8 and CBERS-4 images.
- Copernicus Data Space Environment [CDSE](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/): Open data collections from the EU Copernicus programme.
- Earth on AWS - [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/earth/): Sentinel-2/2A level 2A collections. 
- Digital Earth Africa - [DEAFRICA](https://www.digitalearthafrica.org/): Open data collection of Sentinel-2/2A and Landsat-8 for Africa.
- Digital Earth Australia - [DEAUSTRALIA](https://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/dea): Open data collections for the Australian subcontinent.
- Microsoft Planetary Computer - [MPC](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/catalog): Open data collection of Sentinel-2/2A and Landsat-8.
- NASA Harmonized Landsat/Sentinel Collection [HLS](https://hls.gsfc.nasa.gov/).
- Swiss Data Cube ([SDC](https://www.swissdatacube.org/)): Open data collection of Sentinel-2/2A and Landsat-8.
- [USGS](https://landsatlook.usgs.gov/stac-browser): Landsat-4/5/7/8 collections, which are not open data.

Open data collections do not require payment of access fees. Except for those in the Brazil Data Cube, these collections are not regular. Irregular collections require further processing before they can be used for classification using machine learning models.

### Building a Data Cube from an ARD Image Collection

The following code defines an irregular data cube of Sentinel-2/2A images available in the Microsoft Planetary Computer, using the open data collection `"SENTINEL-2-L2A"`.  The geographical area of the data cube is defined by the tiles `"20LKP"` and `"20LLKP"`, and the temporal extent by a start and end date.  Access to other cloud services works in similar ways. 

```{r, tidy = "styler", echo=TRUE}
s2_cube <- sits_cube(
    source = "MPC",
    collection = "SENTINEL-2-L2A",
    tiles = c("20LKP", "20LLP"),
    bands = c("B03", "B08", "B11", "SCL"),
    start_date = as.Date("2018-07-01"),
    end_date = as.Date("2019-06-30"),
    progress = FALSE
)
```

This cube is irregular. The timelines of tiles `"20LKP"` and `"20LLKP"` and the resolutions of the bands are different. Sentinel-2 bands `"B03"` and `"B08"` have 10-meters resolution, while band `"B11"` and the cloud band `"SCL"` have 20-meters resolution. Irregular collections need an additional processing step to be converted to regular data cubes, as described below.

```{r dcconcept, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%", out.height="90%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Conceptual view of data cubes (source: authors)"}
knitr::include_graphics("inst/extdata/markdown/figures/datacube_conception.jpg")
```

After defining an irregular ARD image collection from a cloud service using `sits_cube()`, users should run `sits_regularize()` to build a regular data cube. This function uses the [gdalcubes R package](https://github.com/appelmar/gdalcubes), described in [Appel and Pebesma, 2019](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/4/3/92). 


```{r, tidy = "styler", eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
gc_cube <- sits_regularize(
    cube          = s2_cube,
    output_dir    = tempdir(),
    period        = "P15D",
    res           = 60,
    multicores    = 4
)
```
The above command builds a regular data cube with all bands interpolated to 60 m spatial resolution and 15-days temporal resolution. Regular data cubes are the input to the `sits` functions for time series retrieval, building machine learning models, and classification of raster images and time series.

## Working with Time Series in `sits`

### Accessing Time Series in Data Cubes

`sits` has been designed to use satellite image time series to derive machine  learning models. After the data cube has been created, time series can be retrieved individually or by using CSV or SHP files, as in the following example. The example below uses a data cube in a local directory, whose images have been obtained from the `"MOD13Q1-6"` collection of the Brazil Data Cube.

```{r, tidy = "styler", eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE} 
library(sits)
# this data cube uses images from the Brazil Data Cube that have
# downloaded to a local directory
data_dir <- system.file("extdata/raster/mod13q1", package = "sits")
# create a cube from downloaded files
raster_cube <- sits_cube(
    source = "BDC",
    collection = "MOD13Q1-6.1",
    data_dir = data_dir,
    delim = "_",
    parse_info = c("X1", "X2", "tile", "band", "date"),
    progress = FALSE
)
# obtain a set of samples defined by a CSV file
csv_file <- system.file("extdata/samples/samples_sinop_crop.csv",
    package = "sits"
)
# retrieve the time series associated with the samples from the data cube
points <- sits_get_data(raster_cube, samples = csv_file)
# show the time series
points[1:3, ]
```

After a time series has been obtained, it is loaded in a tibble. The first six columns contain the metadata: spatial and temporal location, label assigned to the sample, and coverage from where the data has been extracted. The spatial location is given in longitude and latitude coordinates. The first sample has been labelled "Pasture", at location (-55.65931, -11.76267), and is considered valid for the period (2013-09-14, 2014-08-29). 

## Time Series Classification 

### Training Machine Learning Models

`sits` provides support for the classification of both individual time
series as well as data cubes. The following machine learning methods are
available in `sits`:

-   Support vector machines (`sits_svm()`)
-   Random forests (`sits_rfor()`)
-   Extreme gradient boosting (`sits_xgboost()`)
-   Multi-layer perceptrons (`sits_mlp()`)
-   1D convolution neural networks (`sits_tempcnn()`)
-   Temporal self-attention encoder (`sits_tae()`) 
-   Lightweight temporal attention encoder (`sits_lighttae()`)

The following example illustrate how to train a dataset and classify an
individual time series. First we use the `sits_train()` function with two
parameters: the training dataset (described above) and the chosen
machine learning model (in this case, TempCNN). 
The trained model is then used to classify a time series from Mato Grosso
Brazilian state, using `sits_classify()`. The results can be shown in text
format using the function `sits_show_prediction()` or graphically using
`plot`.

```{r, tidy = "styler", fig.align="center", fig.height=3.5, fig.width=7, fig.cap="Classification of NDVI time series using TempCNN", cache=TRUE}
# training data set
data("samples_modis_ndvi")
# point to be classified
data("point_mt_6bands")
# Train a deep learning model
tempcnn_model <- sits_train(
    samples = samples_modis_ndvi,
    ml_method = sits_tempcnn()
)
# Select NDVI band of the  point to be classified
# Classify using TempCNN model
# Plot the result
point_mt_6bands |>
    sits_select(bands = "NDVI") |>
    sits_classify(tempcnn_model) |>
    plot()
```

The following example shows how to classify a data cube organized as a
set of raster images. The result can also be visualized interactively 
using `sits_view()`. 

```{r, tidy = "styler", fig.align="center", fig.height=4.5, fig.width=9, fig.cap="Land use and Land cover in Sinop, MT, Brazil in 2018", cache=TRUE}
# Create a data cube to be classified
# Cube is composed of MOD13Q1 images from the Sinop region in Mato Grosso (Brazil)
data_dir <- system.file("extdata/raster/mod13q1", package = "sits")
sinop <- sits_cube(
    source = "BDC",
    collection = "MOD13Q1-6.1",
    data_dir = data_dir,
    delim = "_",
    parse_info = c("X1", "X2", "tile", "band", "date"),
    progress = FALSE
)
# Classify the raster cube, generating a probability file
# Filter the pixels in the cube to remove noise
probs_cube <- sits_classify(
    data = sinop,
    ml_model = tempcnn_model,
    output_dir = tempdir()
)
# apply a bayesian smoothing to remove outliers
bayes_cube <- sits_smooth(
    cube = probs_cube,
    output_dir = tempdir()
)
# generate a thematic map
label_cube <- sits_label_classification(
    cube = bayes_cube,
    output_dir = tempdir()
)
# plot the the labelled cube
plot(label_cube,
    title = "Land use and Land cover in Sinop, MT, Brazil in 2018"
)
```
