\title{Clustering a set of satellite image time series using SOM}
\usage{
sits_kohonen(data.tb, time_series, bands = NULL, grid_xdim = 25,
  grid_ydim = 25, rlen = 100, dist.fcts = "euclidean", alpha = 1,
  decay.fcts = "exponential", neighbourhood.fct = "bubble", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.tb}{a tibble with samples to be clustered}

\item{time_series}{time series extracted from tibble data.}

\item{bands}{bands to be clustered.}

\item{grid_xdim}{x dimension of the SOM grid (default = 5)}

\item{grid_ydim}{y dimension of the SOM grid}

\item{rlen}{number of times the complete data set will be presented to the SOM grid}

\item{alpha}{learning rate, a vector of two numbers indicating the amount of change.
Default is to decline linearly from 0.05 to 0.01 over rlen updates.}

\item{...}{additional parameters to be passed to kohonen::supersom function}
}
\value{
clusters.tb   a tibble with the clusters time series or cluster' members time series according to return_member parameter.
If return_members are FALSE, the returning tibble will contain a new collumn called `n_members` informing how many members has each cluster.
}
\description{
This function uses package self-organized maps to find clusters in
satellite image time series to cluster samples.
