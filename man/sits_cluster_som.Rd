\title{Clustering a set of satellite image time series using SOM}
\usage{
sits_cluster_som(
  data,
  grid_xdim = 10,
  grid_ydim = 10,
  alpha = 1,
  distance = "euclidean",
  iterations = 50,
  prob_label_change = 0.8,
  min_cluster_prob = 0.6
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A tibble with samples to be clustered.}

\item{grid_xdim}{X dimension of the SOM grid (default = 25).}

\item{grid_ydim}{Y dimension of the SOM grid.}

\item{alpha}{Starting learning rate, which decreases according to number of iterations.}

\item{distance}{The similarity measure (distance).}

\item{iterations}{The number of time to run the SOM cluster.}

\item{prob_label_change}{Threshold of probability to change the label}

\item{min_cluster_prob}{Minimum probability for a good sample to belong to a cluster}
}
\value{
Returns a sits tibble with a new subset of samples and a new column
presenting the probability of each sample belongs to a class described in column label.
}
\description{
This function uses self-organized maps to find clusters in
satellite image time series for quality control of the  samples.
It calls the function \code{\link[sits]{sits_som_map}} to generate the som map and
\code{\link[sits]{sits_som_clean_samples}} to produce a cleaned set of samples.
The parameters "grid_xdim", "grid_ydim", "rlen", "distance", "alpha", and
"iterations are used by \code{\link[sits]{sits_som_map}} to control how the Kohonen map
is generated. The parameters "prob_label_change" and "min_cluster_prob" control how the
good quality samples are selected, based on the Kohonen map.
