\title{Envelope filter}
\usage{
sits_envelope(data.tb = NULL, operations = "UULL", bands_suffix = "env")
}
\arguments{
\item{data.tb}{A tibble with time series data and metadata.}

\item{operations}{A character sequence indicating which operations must be taken. "U" for upper filter, "L" for down filter.}

\item{bands_suffix}{Suffix to be appended to the resulting data (default "env").}
}
\value{
A tibble with filtered time series values.
}
\description{
This function computes the envelope of a time series using the
streaming algorithm proposed by Lemire (2009). This functions calls `dtwclust::compute_envelope` function.
}
\examples{
\donttest{
# Read a set of samples of forest/non-forest in Amazonia
# This is an area full of clouds
data(prodes_226_064)
# Select the NDVI band of the first point
point_ndvi.tb <- sits_select (prodes_226_064[1,], bands = c("ndvi"))
# Apply the envelope filter
point_env.tb <- sits_envelope(point_ndvi.tb)
# Merge the filtered with the raw data
point2.tb <- sits_merge (point_ndvi.tb, point_env.tb)
# Plot the result
sits_plot (point2.tb)
