}
\arguments{
\item{data.tb}{A sits tibble with the time series.}

\item{...}{Logical expressions in the format `name == value`, where `name` is any sits column name
or `bands = c(band names)` for selection of a subset of bands.

\description{
This is a general selection function for extracting any subset of a sits tibble
             It supports spatial selection by lat/long bounding boxes, names of labels,
             start and end dates, and subset of bands.
}
\examples{
# Retrieve a set of time series with 2 classes
data(cerrado_2classes)
# Select only the time series with the "Cerrado" label
data.tb <- sits_select(cerrado_2classes, label == "Cerrado")
# Print the labels of the resulting table
sits_labels(data.tb)
