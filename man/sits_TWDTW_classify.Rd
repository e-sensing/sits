\title{Classify a sits tibble using the matches found by the TWDTW methods}
\usage{
sits_TWDTW_classify(matches, data.tb, start_date = NULL, end_date = NULL,
  interval = "12 month", overlap = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{matches}{a dtwSat S4 object with the matches that have been produced by the sits_TWTDW_matches function}

\item{data.tb}{the SITS tibble used as input for the TWDTW matching function}

\item{start_date}{date - the start of the classification period}

\item{end_date}{date - the end of the classification period}

\item{interval}{the period between two classifications}

\item{overlap}{minimum overlapping between one match and the interval of classification}
}
\value{
matches       a SITS table with the information on matches for the data
}
\description{
Returns a sits table with the results of the TWDTW classifier.
The TWDTW classifier uses the result of the sits_TWDTW_matches function to
find the best alignments of these matches in intervals chosen by the user
