\title{Inerpolation function of the time series of a sits_tibble}
\usage{
sits_interp(data.tb, fun = stats::approx, n = base::length, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.tb}{a valid sits tibble}

\item{fun}{the interpolation function to be used}

\item{n}{the number of time series elements to be created between start date and end date.
When a class function is passed to `n`, is is evaluated with each band time series as
an argument, e.g. n(band) (default: `length` function)}

\item{...}{additional parameters to be used by the fun function}
}
\value{
result.tb    a sits tibble with same samples and the new bands
}
\description{
Computes the linearly interpolated bands for a given resolution
              using the R base function approx
