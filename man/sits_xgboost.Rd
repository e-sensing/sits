sits_xgboost(
  samples = NULL,
  learning_rate = 0.15,
  min_split_loss = 1,
  max_depth = 5,
  min_child_weight = 1,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{samples}{Time series with the training samples.}

\item{learning_rate}{Learning rate: scale the contribution
of each tree by a factor of 0 < lr < 1
when it is added to the current approximation.
Used to prevent overfitting. Default: 0.15}

\item{min_split_loss}{Minimum loss reduction to make a further
partition of a leaf.  Default: 1.}

\item{max_depth}{Maximum depth of a tree.
Increasing this value makes the model more complex
and more likely to overfit. Default: 5.}

\item{min_child_weight}{If the leaf node has a minimum sum of instance
weights lower than min_child_weight,
tree splitting stops. The larger min_child_weight is,
the more conservative the algorithm is. Default: 1.}

\item{max_delta_step}{Maximum delta step we allow each leaf output to be.
If the value is set to 0, there is no constraint.
If it is set to a positive value, it can help making
the update step more conservative. Default: 1.}

\item{subsample}{Percentage of samples supplied to a tree.
Default: 0.8.}

\item{nfold}{Number of the subsamples for the cross-validation.}

\item{nrounds}{Number of rounds to iterate the cross-validation
(default: 100)}

\item{nthread}{Number of threads (default = 6)}

\item{early_stopping_rounds}{Training with a validation set will stop
if the performance doesn't improve for k rounds.}

\item{verbose}{Print information on statistics during the process}
}
\value{
Model fitted to input data
                        (to be passed to \code{\link[sits]{sits_classify}})
}
\description{
This function uses the extreme gradient boosting algorithm.
Boosting iteratively adds basis functions in a greedy fashion
so that each new basis function further reduces the selected loss function.
This function is a front-end to the methods in the "xgboost" package.
Please refer to the documentation in that package for more details.
