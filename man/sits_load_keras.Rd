\title{Load a Keras model for processing in sits}
\usage{
sits_load_keras(hdffile, rdsfile)
}
\arguments{
\item{hdffile}{An hdf5 file where the keras model is to be saved.}

\item{rdsfile}{A rds file where the R environment is to be saved.}
}
\value{
An R Keras model trained by \code{\link[sits]{sits_deeplearning}}.
}
\description{
Takes a save Keras model trained by \code{\link[sits]{sits_deeplearning}}, which has
been saved in two files and loads it in memory for further processing.
One file is the keras model itself (saved as hdf5) and the other is the R enviroment required for sits
to work with the model.
