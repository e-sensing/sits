\arguments{
\item{cube}{\code{sits_cube} object whose observation
period and/or spatial resolution is not constant.}

\item{period}{ISO8601-compliant time period for regular
data cubes, with number and unit, where
"D", "M" and "Y" stand for days, month and year;
 e.g., "P16D" for 16 days.}

\item{res}{Spatial resolution of regularized images (in meters).}

\item{output_dir}{Valid directory for storing regularized images.}

\item{multicores}{Number of cores used for regularization;
used for parallel processing of input.}

\item{memsize}{Memory available for regularization (in GB).}

\item{progress}{show progress bar?}

\item{use_gdalcubes}{Use gdalcubes package? (see details).}
}
\value{
A \code{sits_cube} object with aggregated images.

\description{
Produces regular data cubes for analysis-ready data (ARD)
image collections. Analysis-ready data (ARD) collections available in
AWS, MSPC, USGS and DEAfrica are not regular in space and time.
Bands may have different resolutions,
images may not cover the entire time, and time intervals are not regular.
For this reason, subsets of these collection need to be converted to
regular data cubes before further processing and data analysis.

This function requires users to include the cloud band in their ARD-based
data cubes.
}
\note{
Please refer to the sits documentation available in
<https://e-sensing.github.io/sitsbook/> for detailed examples.

The aggregation method used in \code{sits_regularize}
      sorts the images based on cloud cover, where images with the fewest
      clouds at the top of the stack. Once
      the stack of images is sorted, the method uses the first valid value to
      create the temporal aggregation.

The input (non-regular) ARD cube needs to include the cloud band for
      the regularization to work.
