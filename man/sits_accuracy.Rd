\title{Post-classification accuracy assessment of classified maps}
\usage{
sits_accuracy(results.tb, area, conf.int = 0.95, rm.nosample = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{results.tb}{a sits table with a set of lat/long/time locations with known and trusted labels and
a the result of classifications}

\item{area}{a list with the area of each label}

\item{conf.int}{specifies the confidence level (0-1).}

\item{rm.nosample}{if sum of columns and sum of rows of the error matrix are zero
then remove class. Default is TRUE.}
}
\description{
To use this function, the input table should be a set of results containing
both the label assigned by the user and the classification result.

We plan to do an improved version of this function that includes a Raster R object
with the classified map and a vector with the labels of the classified map
(Gilberto-Rolf-05-Jun-2017)

This function calls \code{\link[dtwSat]{twdtwAssess}} from \pkg{dtwSat}.
\code{\link[dtwSat]{twdtwAssess}} performs an accuracy assessment of the classified, including
Overall Accuracy, User's Accuracy, Produce's Accuracy, error matrix (confusion matrix),
and estimated area according to [1-2].
