\title{Merge two satellite image time series}
\usage{
\method{sits_merge}{sits}(data1, data2)
}
\arguments{
\item{data1}{The first sits tibble to be merged.}

\item{data2}{The second sits tibble to be merged.}
}
\value{
A merged sits tibble with a nested set of time series.
}
\description{
This function merges the time series of two sits tibbles.
To merge two series, we consider that they contain different
attributes but refer to the same data cube, and spatio-temporal location.
This function is useful to merge different bands of the same locations.
For example, one may want to put the raw and smoothed bands
for the same set of locations in the same tibble.
}
\examples{
#' # Retrieve a time series with values of NDVI
data(point_ndvi)
# Filter the point using the whittaker smoother
point_ws.tb <- sits_whittaker(point_ndvi, lambda = 3.0)
# Plot the two points to see the smoothing effect
plot(sits_merge(point_ndvi, point_ws.tb))
