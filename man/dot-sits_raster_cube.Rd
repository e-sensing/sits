\description{
This function creates a tibble containing the metadata for
              a set of spatio-temporal raster files,
              organized as a set of "Raster Bricks".
              These files should be of the same size and
              projection. Each raster brick file should contain one band
              per time step.
              Different bands are archived in different raster files.
