\description{
This function merges the time series of two STIS tables.
To merge two series, we consider that they contain different
attributes but refer to the same coverage, and spatio-temporal location.
This function is useful to merge different bands of the same spatio-temporal locations.
For example, one may want to put the raw and smoothed bands for the same set of locations
in the same table.
