\description{
These functions load and show sits configurations.

The `sits` package uses a configuration file
that contains information on parameters required by different functions.
This includes information about the image collections handled by `sits`.

\code{sits_config()} loads the default configuration file and
the user provided configuration file. The final configuration is
obtained by overriding the options by the values provided by the user.
}
\details{
Users can provide additional configuration files, by specifying the
location of their file in the environmental variable
\code{SITS_CONFIG_USER_FILE} or as parameter to this function.

To see the key entries and contents of the current configuration values,
use \code{link[sits]{sits_config_show()}}.
}
