\title{Save a Keras model for later processing in sits}
\usage{
sits_save_keras(model, hdffile = "./model_keras.h5",
  rdsfile = "./model_keras.rds")
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{An R Keras model trained by \code{\link[sits]{sits_deeplearning}}.}

\item{hdffile}{An hdf5 file where the keras model is to be saved.}

\item{rdsfile}{A rds file where the R environment is to be saved.}
}
\description{
Takes a Keras model trained by \code{\link[sits]{sits_deeplearning}} and saves it in two files.
One file is the keras model itself (saved as hdf5) and the other is the R enviroment required for sits
to work with the model.
