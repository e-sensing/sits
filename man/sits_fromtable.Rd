\title{Obtain timeSeries from WTSS server, based on a SITS tibble}
\usage{
sits_fromtable(table, wtss.obj, cov, bands)
}
\arguments{
\item{table}{a sits tibble}

\item{wtss.obj}{an R object that represents the WTSS server}

\item{cov}{a list with the coverage parameters (retrived from the WTSS server)}

\item{bands}{string vector - the names of the bands to be retrieved}
}
\value{
data.tb       tibble  - a SITS table
}
\description{
reads descriptive information about a set of
spatio-temporal locations from a SITS tibble. Then it uses the WTSS service to
obtain the required data. This function is useful when you have a sits tibble
but you want to get the time series from a different set of bands.
