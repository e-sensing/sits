\title{Area-weighted post-classification accuracy assessment of classified maps}
\usage{
sits_accuracy_area(class.tb, area = NULL, conf.int = 0.95,
  rm.nosample = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{class.tb}{A sits tibble with a set of lat/long/time locations with known and trusted labels and
with the result of classification method.}

\item{area}{A list with the area of each label.}

\item{conf.int}{Specifies the confidence level (0-1).}

\item{rm.nosample}{If sum of columns and sum of rows of the error matrix are zero
then remove class. Default is TRUE.}
}
\description{
To use this function, the input table should be a set of results containing
both the label assigned by the user and the classification result.
Accuracy assessment set us a confusion matrix to determine the accuracy of your classified result.
This function uses an area-weighted technique proposed by Olofsson et al. to
produce accuracy estimates that are more reliable.

This function calls \code{\link[dtwSat]{twdtwAssess}} from \pkg{dtwSat}.
\code{\link[dtwSat]{twdtwAssess}} performs an accuracy assessment of the classified, including
Overall Accuracy, User's Accuracy, Produce's Accuracy, error matrix (confusion matrix),
and estimated area according to [1-2].
