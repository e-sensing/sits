\title{Train a sits classification model with a gradient boosting machine}
\usage{
sits_gbm(data.tb = NULL, formula = sits_formula_logref(),
  distribution = "multinomial", n.trees = 500, interaction.depth = 2,
  shrinkage = 0.001, cv.folds = 5, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.tb}{Time series with the training samples.}

\item{formula}{A symbolic description of the model to be fit. Package sits offers a set of such formulas (default: sits_formula_logref).}

\item{distribution}{Name of the distribution - use "multinomial" for classification.}

\item{n.trees}{Number of trees to fit. This should not be set to too small a number,
to ensure that every input row gets predicted at least a few times. (default: 5000).}

\item{interaction.depth}{The maximum depth of variable interactions. 1 implies an additive model, 2 implies a model with up to 2-way interactions.}

\item{shrinkage}{A shrinkage parameter applied to each tree in the expansion.
Also known as the learning rate or step-size reduction.}

\item{cv.folds}{Number of cross-validations to run.}

\item{...}{Other parameters to be passed to `gbm::gbm` function.}
}
\value{
A model function to be passed in sits_predict or an function prepared that can be called further to compute multinom training model
}
\description{
This function implements the generalized boosted modeling framework.
Boosting is the process of iteratively adding basis functions in a greedy fashion
so that each additional basis function further reduces the selected loss function.
This function is a front-end to the "gbm" method in the "gbm" package.
Please refer to the documentation in that package for more details.

\donttest{
# Retrieve the set of samples for the Mato Grosso region (provided by EMBRAPA)
data(samples_MT_ndvi)
# Build a GBM model
gbm_model <- sits_train(samples_MT_ndvi, sits_gbm(n.trees = 200, cv.folds = 2))
# get a point with a 16 year time series
data(point_ndvi)
# classify the point
class.tb <- sits_classify (point_ndvi, gbm_model)
# plot the classification
sits_plot(class.tb)
