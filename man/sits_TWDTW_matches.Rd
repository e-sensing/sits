\title{Find matches between a set of SITS patterns and segments of sits tibble using TWDTW}
\usage{
sits_TWDTW_matches(data.tb = NULL, patterns.tb = NULL, bands = NULL,
  dist.method = "euclidean", alpha = -0.1, beta = 100, theta = 0.5,
  span = 250, keep = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.tb}{a table in SITS format with a time series to be classified using TWTDW}

\item{patterns.tb}{a set of known temporal signatures for the chosen classes}

\item{bands}{string - the bands to be used for classification}

\item{dist.method}{A character. Method to derive the local cost matrix.}

\item{alpha}{(double) - the steepness of the logistic function used for temporal weighting}

\item{beta}{(integer) - the midpoint (in days) of the logistic function}

\item{theta}{(double)  - the relative weight of the time distance compared to the dtw distance}

\item{span}{minimum number of days between two matches of the same pattern in the time series (approximate)}

\item{keep}{keep internal values for plotting matches}
}
\value{
matches       a dtwSat S4 object with the matches
}
\description{
Returns  the results of the TWDTW matching function.
The TWDTW matching function compares the values of a satellite image time series with
the values of known patters and tries to match each pattern to a part of the time series

The TWDTW (time-weighted dynamical time warping) is a version of the
Dynamic Time Warping method for land use and land cover mapping using a sequence
of multi-band satellite images. Methods based on dynamic time warping are flexible to
handle irregular sampling and out-of-phase time series, and they have achieved significant
results in time series analysis. In contrast to standard DTW, the TWDTW method is sensitive to seasonal
changes of natural and cultivated vegetation types. It also considers inter-annual climatic and
seasonal variability.
