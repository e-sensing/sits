\title{Create temporal patterns using a generalised additive model (gam)}
\usage{
sits_gam(data.tb = NULL, from = NULL, to = NULL, freq = 8, formula = y
  ~ s(x), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.tb}{a tibble in SITS format with time series to be classified using TWTDW}

\item{from}{starting date of the estimate (month-day)}

\item{to}{end data of the estimated (month-day)}

\item{freq}{int - the interval in days for the estimates to be generated}

\item{formula}{the formula to be applied in the estimate}

\item{...}{any additional parameters}
}
\value{
patterns.tb   a SITS tibble with the patterns
}
\description{
This function takes a set of time series samples as input
estimates a set of patterns. The patterns are calculated based in a GAM model.
The idea is to use a formula of type y ~ s(x), where x is a temporal
reference and y if the value of the signal. For each time, there will be as many predictions
as there are sample values. The GAM model predicts a suitable
approximation that fits the assumptions of the statistical model.
By default, the gam methods  produces an approximation based on a smooth function.

This method is based on the "createPatterns" method of the dtwSat package, which is also
described in the reference paper.
