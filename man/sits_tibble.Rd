\description{
this function returns an empty sits table.
SITS tibbles are the main structures of the "sits" package.
A sits tibble is a tibble with pre-defined columns that
has the metadata and data for each time series. The columns are
<longitude, latitude, start_date, end_date, label, coverage, time_series>
Most functions on the sits package use a sits tibble as input (with additional parameters)
and a sits tibble as output. This allows for chaining of operation on time series.
