\description{
takes a sits table with different labels and
             returns a new table. For a given field as a group criterion, this new table contains a given number or percentage
             of the total number of samples per group. Parameter n indicantes the number of random samples with reposition.
             Parameter frac indicates a fraction of random samples without reposition. If frac > 1, the sampling is taken with reposition.
