\title{Smooth the time series using Savitsky-Golay filter}
\usage{
sits_sgolay(data.tb = NULL, order = 3, scale = 1, bands_suffix = "sg")
}
\arguments{
\item{data.tb}{A tibble with time series data and metadata.}

\item{order}{Filter order (integer).}

\item{scale}{Time scaling (integer).}

\item{bands_suffix}{Suffix to be appended to the smoothed filters.}
}
\value{
A tibble with smoothed sits time series.
}
\description{
The algorithm searches for an optimal polynomial describing the warping.
The degree of smoothing depends on the filter order (usually 3.0).
Use lambda = 0.5 for very slight smoothing and lambda = 5.0 for strong smoothing.

\examples{
\donttest{
#' # Retrieve a time series with values of NDVI
data(point_ndvi)
# Filter the point using the Savitsky Golay smoother
point_sg.tb <- sits_sgolay (point_ndvi, order = 3, scale = 2)
# Plot the two points to see the smoothing effect
sits_plot(sits_merge(point_ndvi, point_sg.tb))
}
