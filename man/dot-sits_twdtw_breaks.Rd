\title{Classify a sits tibble using the matches found by the TWDTW methods}
\usage{
.sits_twdtw_breaks(
  matches,
  data,
  start_date = NULL,
  end_date = NULL,
  interval = "12 month",
  overlap = 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{matches}{A dtwSat S4 object with the matches that have been produced by the sits_TWTDW_matches function.}

\item{data}{A sits tibble used as input for the TWDTW matching function.}

\item{start_date}{The start date of the classification period.}

\item{end_date}{The end date of the classification period.}

\item{interval}{The period between two classifications.}

\item{overlap}{Minimum overlapping between one match and the interval of classification.}
}
\value{
A sits tibble with the information on matches for the data.
}
\description{
Returns a sits tibble with the results of the TWDTW classifier.
The TWDTW classifier uses the result of the sits_TWDTW_matches function to
find the best alignments of these matches in intervals chosen by the user
