\usage{
sits_uncertainty_sampling(
  uncert_cube,
  n = 100,
  min_uncert = 0.4,
  sampling_window = 10,
  multicores = 1,
  memsize = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{uncert_cube}{An uncertainty cube.
See \code{\link[sits]{sits_uncertainty}}.}

\item{n}{Number of suggested points to be sampled per tile.}

\item{min_uncert}{Minimum uncertainty value to select a sample.}

\item{sampling_window}{Window size for collecting points (in pixels).
The minimum window size is 10.}

\item{multicores}{Number of workers for parallel processing
(integer, min = 1, max = 2048).}

\item{memsize}{Maximum overall memory (in GB) to run the
function.}
}
\value{
A tibble with longitude and latitude in WGS84 with locations
which have high uncertainty and meet the minimum distance
criteria.
}
\description{
Suggest samples for regions of high uncertainty as predicted by the model.
The function selects data points that have confused an algorithm.
These points don't have labels and need be manually labelled by experts
and then used to increase the classification's training set.

This function is best used in the following context:
 1. Select an initial set of samples.
 2. Train a machine learning model.
 3. Build a data cube and classify it using the model.
 4. Run a Bayesian smoothing in the resulting probability cube.
 5. Create an uncertainty cube.
 6. Perform uncertainty sampling.

The Bayesian smoothing procedure will reduce the classification outliers
and thus increase the likelihood that the resulting pixels with high
uncertainty have meaningful information.
