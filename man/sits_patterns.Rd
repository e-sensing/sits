\title{Create temporal patterns using a generalised additive model (gam)}
\usage{
sits_patterns(data.tb = NULL, timeline = NULL, start_date = NULL,
  end_date = NULL, freq = 8, formula = y ~ s(x), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data.tb}{A tibble in sits format with time series.}

\item{timeline}{A timeline vector with the all dates for the coverage.}

\item{start_date}{Starting date (month-day).}

\item{end_date}{End date (month-day).}

\item{freq}{Interval in days for the estimates to be generated.}

\item{formula}{Formula to be applied in the estimate.}

\item{...}{Any additional parameters.}
}
\value{
A sits tibble with the patterns.
}
\description{
This function takes a set of time series samples as input
estimates a set of patterns. The patterns are calculated based in a GAM model.
The idea is to use a formula of type y ~ s(x), where x is a temporal
reference and y if the value of the signal. For each time, there will be as many predictions
as there are sample values. The GAM model predicts a suitable
approximation that fits the assumptions of the statistical model.
By default, the GAM method produces an approximation based on a smooth function.

This method is based on the "createPatterns" method of the dtwSat package, which is also
described in the reference paper.

\donttest{
# Read a set of samples for two classes
data(cerrado_2classes)
# Estimate a set of patterns (one for each label)
patterns.tb <- sits_patterns(cerrado_2classes)
# Show the patterns
sits_plot(patterns.tb)

# Read a set of samples for the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, provided by EMBRAPA
data(samples_MT_9classes)
# Estimate a set of patterns (one for each label)
patterns.tb <- sits_patterns(samples_MT_9classes)
# Show the patterns
