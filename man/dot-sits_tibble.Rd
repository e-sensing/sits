This function returns an empty sits tibble.
Sits tibbles are the main structures of sits package.
They contain both the satellite image time series and its metadata.
A sits tibble is a tibble with pre-defined columns that
has the metadata and data for each time series. The columns are
<longitude, latitude, start_date, end_date, label, cube, time_series>.
Most functions of sits package get a sits tibble as input
(with additional parameters)
and return another sits tibble as output.
This allows chaining functions over sits tibbles.
