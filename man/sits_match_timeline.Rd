\title{Find dates in the input coverage that match those of the patterns}
\usage{
sits_match_timeline(timeline, ref_start_date, ref_end_date,
  interval = "12 month")
}
\arguments{
\item{timeline}{Timeline of input observations (vector).}

\item{ref_start_date}{The day of the year to be taken as reference for starting the classification.}

\item{ref_end_date}{The day of the year to be taken as reference for end the classification.}

\item{interval}{Period between two classification.}
}
\value{
A list of breaks that will be applied to the input data set.
}
\description{
For correct classification, the time series of the input data set
             should be aligned to that of the reference data set (usually a set of patterns).
             This function aligns these data sets so that shape matching works correctly
}

# get a timeline for MODIS data

# get a set of subsets for a period of 10 years
