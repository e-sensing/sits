#  The data contain 1,892 time series samples for the Mato Grosso state in Brasil.
#  The time series come from MOD13Q1 collection 6 images, with 6 bands
#  ("blue", "red", "nir", "mir",  "evi",  and "ndvi")
#  The data set has the following classes:
#  Cerrado(379 samples), Fallow_Cotton (29 samples), Forest (131 samples),
#  Pasture (344 samples), Soy-Corn (364 samples),  Soy-Cotton (352 samples),
#  Soy_Fallow (87 samples), Soy_Millet (186 samples),
#  and Soy_Sunflower (26 samples).
#  The tibble has 7 variables:
#  (a) longitude: East-west coordinate of the time series sample (WGS 84);
#  (b) latitude (North-south coordinate of the time series sample in WGS 84),
#  (c) start_date (initial date of the time series),
#  (d) end_date (final date of the time series),
#  (e) label (the class label associated to the sample),
#  (f) cube (the name of the cube associated with the data),
#  (g) time_series (tibble with the values of the time series).
